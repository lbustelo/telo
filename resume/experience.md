## Experience
#### SOFTWARE ARCHITECT, TALROO; AUSTIN, TX — 2018–PRESENT
End-to-End ownership of **Data products**, including design and architecture, implementation, deployment automation, and operations. Products range from Data Warehouse ETL, data collection endpoints, personalization and machine learning. Using **AWS** API Gateway, Cognito, AWS **Lambda**, DynamoDB, Kinesis, S3, Cloudwatch, **CloudFormation**, Ansible, **Docker**, Python, **Spark** on Databricks, Azure Pipelines, among others.

#### SENIOR TECHNICAL STAFF MEMBER, IBM; AUSTIN, TX — 2012–2018
Focus areas include **Data analytics**, **Machine Learning**, **Cloud architecture**, and **DevOps**. Lead the inception, architecture, staffing and implementation of several projects. Here are some of the highlights:

**Fast Data for Business** is a collection of cloud infrastructure patterns informed by The Weather Company's experience in building large scale and highly available data products. These patterns are implemented using technologies like **Terraform**, **Docker**, and **Chef**, and are meant to be combined to build dedicated cloud environments for customers.

**Blackbox** is a platform built for application developers to define micro-services the are backed by **Machine Learning** models and learn through feedback data. The system orchestrates a **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)**-like competition, where a variety of ML pipelines, running in **Docker** containers, compete to provide the best model. The winning model is automatically deployed into production without the developer’s intervention.

Organized a **Chat-bot** Hack-athon as a team-wide skill building event. Built a **Slack** based game around the Giphy command. Built a bot that integrated with Github to enable participants to register and vote for ideas. Built a tamagotchi-style bot that uses **[Wit.ai](https://wit.ai/)** to interpret users intent.

**[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)** Dashboards and Widgets are a set of extensions to the Jupyter Notebook that allows the user to transform a code-filled notebook into an interactive application or dashboards. Created a declarative way of creating visual and data widgets that using **[Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)** and backed by **Python**, **Scala** and **R** implementations. More information at [https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/declarativewidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/declarativewidgets).

**Apache Toree** is a Jupyter kernel that enables users of the Jupyter Notebook to interact with **Apache Spark** using **Scala**. Responsible for identifying the value of Scala and Jupyter kernels to enable interactive development on Spark. Original developer and committer to the open source project at [https://github.com/apache/incubator-toree](https://github.com/apache/incubator-toree). Toree is actively used as part of several IBM products, most notably [http://datascience.ibm.com/](http://datascience.ibm.com/).

**LiveSheets** is a Notebook style tool intended for business users that enable data analytics on top of **Apache Spark** and **Apache Storm**. Used heavily in evangelization efforts in support of IBM’s involvement in Spark (i.e. Spark Summit 2014-2015 and [Oreilly Strata 2014](https:// conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strataeu2014/public/schedule/detail/39052)).

#### SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER, IBM; AUSTIN, TX — 2008-2011
This period is marked by the beginning of work in the **Big Data** space, such as **Hadoop**, and **analytics**. Main responsibilities included leading development teams and actively contributing as a Full-stack engineer and architect. Here are some of the highlights:

**Watson Q/A System Tooling** involved converting many of the tools used by IBM Research to experiment on and train the Jeopardy-winning system into a modern and cohesive web based stack. The work served as a tooling foundation, used in the early days of the Watson division.

**BigSheets** is a spreadsheet-like interface that operates on top of **Apache Hadoop**. Main responsibilities involved designing and implementing the user interface, as well as front-side backend pieces. The project was adopted by IBM’s Big Insights product-line.

#### EARLIER CAREER, IBM; AUSTIN, TX — 2002-2008
Primarily focused on Rich Internet Applications and developing tools to help create rich browser- based interfaces. Played a key role in developing tools within eclipse.org.

**AJAX Tooling Framework** was an extension to **Eclipse** that allows the web developer to author HTML. Integrated the **Mozilla** engine to provide a live preview, error console, and DOM inspector.

Adobe Flex and OpenLaszlo eclipse extensions to enable authoring using a declarative markup that compiled to Flash.

Joint effort with Zend to build the initial prototype of **PHP** Eclipse, a full-featured PHP IDE.
